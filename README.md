# Budget Genshin Wwish Simulator
This Genshin Wish Simulator (GWS) started as a joke, but I am now actually dedicated to finishing this project.
This is basically an simulation of Genshin Wishing process, where you can get characters and weapons. 
I've tried to simulate the pirt, soft pity and all of the other aspects of gacha system.

This is all made by me, Ducky, and that's why it can be a bit broken. Feel free to tell me what to improve on! 

Every 10 wishes - guaranteed 4* character
Starting from 75 wishes - 20% to get 5* character (Otherwise only 0.6% before 75 wishes)
And at 90 wishes - guaranteed 5* character

You can buy wishes with 1 and 2 - Press 1 to buy one wish, 2 to buy ten of them.
And you can wish with 3 and 4 - Press 3 to wish once, and 4 to wish ten times.
Enjoy!
